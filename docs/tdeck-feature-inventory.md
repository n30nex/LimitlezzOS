# T-Deck Firmware Feature Inventory

Audit date: 2026-06-13

Refresh note: Wi-Fi credential rows were updated on 2026-06-19 from current
code evidence; full hardware smoke remains subject to the release evidence
workflow.

Status labels:

- Functional: implementation exists and is wired into the firmware path.
- Partial: important code exists, but the feature is incomplete or gated.
- Prototype: UI/demo behavior exists without the real backend.
- Planned: specified in README/design docs but not implemented in code.
- Needs validation: implementation exists but was not hardware-verified during this audit.

| Feature | Status | Evidence | Gap / Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T-Deck PlatformIO firmware target | Functional, CI-covered, needs hardware validation | `platformio.ini`, `src/main_tdeck.cpp`; `.github/workflows/firmware.yml` builds `pio run -e tdeck`, captures size output, and uploads firmware artifacts | Keep validating board profile against actual T-Deck flash/PSRAM during hardware smoke runs. |

## Completion Criteria

The firmware should not be called complete until all of the following are true:

1. T-Deck build, upload, boot, and hardware smoke tests are repeatable.
2. Meshtastic public channel and DMs work with stock devices, including ACK/retry UX.
3. MeshCore public channel, rooms, DMs, ADVERTs, and TDM run alongside Meshtastic without regressions.
4. App Store installs and launches sandboxed apps from a real catalog or local app directory.
5. Optional apps cover repo-listed app goals without bloating the base OS.
6. OTA can update the firmware safely.
7. Security settings protect credentials, keys, identity, and message history.
8. Terminal/diagnostics are hidden behind Developer Mode.
9. CI and release docs prove the state on every release.
