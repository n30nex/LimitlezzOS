# Local App Manifest

Local apps are the first V0.95 app-platform step. They are scanned from local
storage only; there is no network catalog, download, or script runtime in this
step.

## Search Paths

On T-Deck hardware, packages are discovered from:

- `/sd/limitlezz/apps/<app-id>/`
- `/sd/apps/<app-id>/`
- `/appfs/apps/<app-id>/`

In the native simulator, packages are discovered from:

- `<sim-data-dir>/apps/<app-id>/`

## Package Layout

Each package directory must contain:

- `manifest.json`
- the manifest `entry` file, relative to the package directory
- optional assets or per-app data files

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "weather.mesh",
  "name": "Weather Mesh",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "author": "Limitless",
  "summary": "Local weather dashboard",
  "entry": "main.lua",
  "icon": "weather",
  "hue": 48
}
```

## Accepted Fields

Required:

- `id`: letters, numbers, `_`, `-`, or `.`
- `name`: display name
- `entry`: relative entry file path

Optional:

- `version`: shown in App Store and app detail, defaults to `0.0.0`
- `author`: shown in App Store and app detail, defaults to `local`
- `summary` or `description`: short display text
- `icon`: token such as `calculate`, `note`, `weather`, `map`, `game`,
  `terminal`, `folder`, or `description`
- `hue`: tile hue hint; unsupported values fall back to the neutral tile color

## Safety Rules

The scanner rejects packages when:

- `manifest.json` is missing, empty, or larger than the bounded parser accepts
- required fields are missing
- `id` contains path separators or unsafe characters
- `entry` is absolute, contains `..`, contains a Windows drive separator, or is
  missing on disk

The current firmware only scans and displays local app manifests. Script
execution, sandbox APIs, permissions, app data quotas, and network catalog
installs remain later app-platform work.
